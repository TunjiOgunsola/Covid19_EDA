# Covid19_EDA

COVID-19 infection data (Excel format) was downloaded from the World Health Organization website - https://www.who.int/data
I divided the table into two namely; CovidDeaths and CovidVacinnations
Then I did an Exploratory Data Analysis EDA on the tables in the SQL server.
I emphasized more on my country of operation (Nigeria) and also  the rate of infection and fatality of COVID-19 on a global scale.
