# Covid19_EDA

Covid19 infection data (xlx format) was downlowded from World Health Organization website - https://www.who.int/data
I divided the table into two namely; CovidDeaths and CovidVacinnations
Then I did an Eploratory Data Analysis EDA on the tables in SQL server.
I emphasized more on my country of operation (Nigeria) and also  the rate of infection and fatality of covid19 on global scale.
